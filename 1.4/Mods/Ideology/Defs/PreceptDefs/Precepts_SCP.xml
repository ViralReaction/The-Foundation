    <description>We view SCPs primarily as valuable tools and resources. The anomalous properties are a means to further the colony's progress, efficiency, and survival.\n\n&lt;color=#E5E54C&gt;Gameplay effect:&lt;/color&gt;\n - No opinion generation of SCPs.\n - No thoughts related to SCPs dying (works for all colonists as long as precept is part of primary ideology).\n - No thoughts related to SCPs being enslaved (works for all colonists as long as precept is part of primary ideology).</description>
